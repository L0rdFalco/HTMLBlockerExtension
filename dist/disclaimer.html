            <p>Hi ðŸ‘‹,</p>

            <p>Happy to announce an update that will help maintain this test extension free and available to
                everybody...but
                it requires action from you!</p>

            <p>As the developer of this test extension, I get a small share of the revenue.</p>

            <p>By opting in now, other than helping maintain this test extension free and available, you will
                be eligible to
                be in the beta version and start earning for your unused internet too. In case you change your mind, you
                can
                opt out at any time</p>

            <p> Security and privacy are 100% guaranteed and the <a
                    href="https://github.com/mellowtel-inc/mellowtel-js">Monetization library</a> is open
                source for everyone to see.</p>

            <p>It doesn't collect, share, or sell personal information (not even anonymized data). Itâ€™s also highly
                regulated:
                THe Monetization library keeps communicating with Chrome Web Store regulators to guarantee a safe
                experience. It also
                provides CWS regulators with tools to monitor and enforce compliance.</p>

            <p>Thanks!</p>
